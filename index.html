        <div>As computer science students, we are exposed to many programming platforms and languages and we are trained to write codes to solve all sorts of computing problems. 
            Heavy computing resources such as cluster machines are used to process the heavy duty data processing tasks and web servers are used to host the results and reports from data processing.

            However, visualization and report sharing have been a gradually moving towards web because of its easy accessibility and minimal setup for users. 
            Lack of proper web design skills can lead to poorly designed web pages which can be very un-welcoming to the users. 
            So it is very important to obtain proper web design skills to make web pages visually pleasing and user-friendly. 
            Hopefully in this course, I will learn to use CSS frameworks and HTML tricks to improve my web development skills.
